# \# Legal Uncertainty Index (IIJ)

# 

# This repository documents the data collection and processing workflow used to construct the \*\*Legal Uncertainty Index (IIJ)\*\*. The project integrates automated web scraping, text processing, and quantitative analysis to measure regulatory uncertainty based on official draft decree documents published in Colombia.

# 

# The current stage of the project focuses on the ingestion and organization of regulatory text data as the primary input for downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) and index construction tasks.

# 

# \## Project Objective

# 

# The main objective of this project is to develop a reproducible and transparent pipeline for building a Legal Uncertainty Index that captures variations in regulatory activity and institutional uncertainty over time.

# 

# Specifically, the project aims to:

# 

# \- Collect official regulatory draft documents from public government sources.

# \- Organize and store raw textual data in a structured format.

# \- Prepare the dataset for text preprocessing, network modeling, and index computation.

# \- Support empirical analysis related to legal and economic uncertainty.

# \## Data Source

# 

# The primary data source is the official website of the \*\*Colombian Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism (MinCIT)\*\*.

# 

# The current dataset covers regulatory draft documents published during the period:

# 

# \- \*\*2018–2025\*\*
